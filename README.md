# Street Vibration App 

The goal of this app is to track cars driving 
on the street with the help of the mobile's gyroscope
sensor. According to how accurate the sensor's output is, 
you might tell trucks and normal cars apart. 

I made this app during my studies at the HTW (univeristy of applied science). 
Course mobile applications.
